Roadmap
=======

Current status
--------------

At this point, collective.table offers only basic functionalities and is somewhat
usable. It's in alpha stage so storage API *will* change and there will be 
*no migration path*. Do not use for storing important data just yet!

Milestone `Sauna Sprint`
------------------------

Both Nejc Zupan (GSoC student) and Martijn Pieters (mentor) will be attending
the Plone Sauna Sprint 2011. During that week we will focus on the following:

* improve ZODB source (sorting, filtering, scalability and such)
* improve UI
* add more tests (test coverage is already above 85%, btw)
* unit-tests for Javascript

Milestone `End of GSoC`
-----------------------

* battle-hardening what we produce during the Sauna Sprint
* selenium tests, ran regularly with help of jenkins.plone.org
* improve user and developer documentation
* export data to csv, etc
* screencast usage demo

Milestone `future`
------------------

* column types (numeric, date, boolean, vocabularies, etc.)
* add SQLAlchemy source, based on SQLite by default
* import from csv
* insertion of rows in the middle, together with concurrent editing
* PloneFormGen integration
