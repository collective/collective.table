Roadmap
=======

Current status
--------------

At this point, collective.table offers basic functionalities and is usable. It
can be used as an out-of-the-box product for end-users or as a third-party
Archetypes widget for custom content-types.


Future
------

Being pluggable as it is, we expect more people to use it with their own
content-types on their own custom data sources. Hopefully some that code will
propagate back into the community so we can have multiple source possibilities
in the future. UI could also use some more love.
