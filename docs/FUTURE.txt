Ideas for future features:

* New types beyond string:
  * Numeric (float, integer, constraints)
  * URLs
  * Date/time
  * Boolean (checkboxes)
  * Vocabularies? (selects)
* SQL integration
* Search (DataTables supports a search box)
* i18n: set correct language based on the rest of the page's language.
* Row / table editing issues to deal with:
  * insertion of rows in the middle, together with concurrent editing
  * cell editing, together with concurrent editing
