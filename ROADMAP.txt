Roadmap
=======

Current status
--------------

Currently, collective.table offers only basic functionalities and is somewhat
usable. It's in alpha stage so storage API *will* change and there will be 
no migration path. Do not use for storing important data just yet!

Milestone `Sauna Sprint`
------------------------

Both Nejc Zupan (GSoC student) and Martijn Pieters (mentor) will be attending
the Plone Sauna Sprint 2011. During that week we will focus on two things:

 * improve ZODB storage (sorting, filtering, scalability and such)
 * improve UI
 * add more tests (test coverage *is* above 85%, btw).
 * unit-tests for Javascript

Milestone `End of GSoC`
-----------------------

 * Battle-hardening what we produce during the Sauna Sprint.
 * Selenium tests, ran regularly with help of jenkins.plone.org.
 * Improve user and developer documentation.
 * Export data to csv, etc.
 * Screencast usage demo.

Milestone `future`
------------------

 * Add SQLAlchemy storage, based on SQLite by default.
 * Import.

To do
=====

 * Add some more tests
